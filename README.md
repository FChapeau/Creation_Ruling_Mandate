Creation_Ruling_Mandate
=======================

Software made to manage Exalted's 2nd edition's Creation Ruling Mandate.

The Creation Ruling Mandate is a system created for Exalted 2nd Edition by White Wolf Publishing (All rights reserved and all that jazz.) It is a system aiming to simplify the management of organisations and create abstractions to make use of organisations effortlessly. And I thought: Let's make it even easier and create a GUI tool to manage it!

I'm aiming to create a simple and intuitive GUI tool based a lot on drag and drop so you can drag "organisation cards" around on the organisation chart, drag and drop "Capital Tokens" from card to card, manage dice rolls and organisation activities, manage capital and everything within the system.
